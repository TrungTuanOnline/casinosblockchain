                        <div className="h2">Where To Place Sports Bets With Bitcoin And Other Cryptos?	</div>
                        <p>Although still not as widespread as their fiat-currency counterparts, sports betting sites accepting <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/cryptocurrencies/">Bitcoin and other coins</a> are relatively easy to find.</p>
                        <p>However, <strong>not all Bitcoin sports betting sites are the same</strong>. </p>
                        <p>Many casinos offer a sportsbook section alongside their core product, while others (like <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/thunderpick-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thunderpick</a> for example) specialize in sports.</p>
                        <p>What's more, the betting options themselves can vary:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_bubbles"><li>Pre-Match</li><li>In-Play</li><li>eSports</li><li>Virtual Sports</li></ul>
                        <p>Let's have a look at each of these options and the casinos and sportsbook websites where you can play them with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

                        <div className="h3">Pre-Match Betting At Crypto Casinos	</div>
                        <p>Alongside in-play (or live) betting, pre-match betting is the original form of sports betting, <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/58041" target="_blank">dating back thousands of years to Ancient Greece's Olympic Games</a>.</p>
                        <p>The difference between pre-match bets and in-play bets is simple: while the former are placed right until the start of the event, the latter can only be placed after the event has started.</p>
                        <p>Traditional sports betting is so widespread, it takes place almost anywhere: </p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>In casual bets made between friends at sports bars.</li><li>Online at big and small websites alike.</li><li>At Vegas casinos.</li><li>At traditional betting shops.</li><li>Through state-sponsored betting monopolies.</li></ul>
                        <p>Therefore, it's not surprising it has reached the blockchain casino world. </p>
                        <p>We've selected the following three as the top sports betting casinos where you can play with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

                        <p>As a reminder, <strong>BC.Game is also a leading crypto casino</strong> that offers slots, live games, and provably fair games. So, if you're a casino-goer looking to try out sports betting, we couldn't recommend this site more: </p>

                        <p>Although virtual sports have been around for a while, it was the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that really <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egr.global/technology/insight/vital-virtuals-how-virtual-sports-capitalised-on-coronavirus/" target="_blank">put them on the map</a>.</p>
                        <p>Since these fixed-odds events don't have audiences, players, nor do they require a venue and complicated logistics to take place, they are ideal events for lockdown times.</p>
                        <p>But how do they work? The answer is simple: with a random number generator, just like slot machines.</p>
                        <p>As such, they're perfect for cryptocurrency betting:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>There are no third-party influences, no match-fixing, nor corrupted results.</li><li>It's beginner-friendly since there's a short learning curve and you don't have to follow sports events to take part.</li><li>Events take place round-the-clock and they are not seasonal nor geographically restricted.</li></ul>
                        <p>Unfortunately, only a select few blockchain casinos offer virtual sports. These are the very best:</p>

                        <p>Although cryptocurrency betting websites can offer a higher degree of anonymity and quicker and cheaper transactions than their fiat counterparts, they still fail to provide a fully transparent and private betting environment.</p>
                        <p>If you want <em>real</em> anonymity and no middle man, you have to look for gambling Dapps.</p>

                                Decentralized applications forego deposits and withdrawals. Instead, you can bet directly from your wallet, which means that you get your earnings nearly instantly and virtually hassle-free.

                        </div>
                        <p className="mt-2">Unfortunately, sports betting Dapps are not as widespread as we would hope.</p>
                        <p>Unlike decentralized casinos, truly reliable Dapps where you can place sports bets are hard to find, especially ones offering a good betting experience.</p>
                        <p>However, there are two that stand out: <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sportx.bet/" target="_blank">SportX</a> and <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sportbet.one/" target="_blank">SportBet</a>.</p>
                        <img src={SportxLogo} alt="SportxLogo" />
                        <p className="mt-2">SportX is an Ethereum-based sports betting Dapp offering DAI payments.</p>
                        <p>Since it was built on a <strong>publicly-available smart contract</strong>, the app can guarantee full transparency and <strong>enhanced security</strong> while providing instant and <strong>hassle-free transactions</strong>. </p>
                        <p>As an added layer of security, SportX also holds a <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://validator.antillephone.com/validate?domain=sportx.bet&amp;seal_id=8ffb7df23f70b8c60804e078fcd57a9b2022a4c5317d0d463ad22abd8daf9e18ed928a1838bb6a2022dbbc1aea874fd8&amp;stamp=e7f2a564a57029f868210456ae554b4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling license from CuraÃ§ao</a>. </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the license does mean that players from countries such as the United States are excluded from gambling here.</p>
                        <p>At the time of writing, SportX offered bets on the following events: </p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>American football</li><li>Association football (soccer)</li><li>Current affairs</li><li>Major elections</li><li>Cryptocurrency prices</li></ul>

                        <p className="mt-2">SportsBet is an EOS-based Dapp that doesn't require any form of identity verification since all payments are made directly to and from your e-wallet.</p>
                        <p>Although it doesn't hold a gambling license, it offers a wider range of betting options than SportX:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_bubbles"><li>Association Football (Soccer)</li><li>Tennis</li><li>Basketball</li><li>American Football</li><li>Baseball</li><li>eSports</li><li>And More!</li></ul>
                        <p>Market variety is certainly appreciated, but the lack of a gambling license is somewhat concerning. Although we've encountered no issues when testing the platform, we advise caution if you do decide to try it out.</p>

                        <p>You now know all about the top-field Bitcoin sports betting websites where you can find great odds, but you may still be feeling a bit lost.</p>
                        <p>After all, choosing the right Bitcoin sportsbook is the most crucial step in becoming a punter.</p>
                        <p>You can always <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/">read our reviews</a> for each of the suggested sites if you want to learn more about them. But we'll do you one better.</p>
                        <p>We're going to teach you how to select the right sportsbook for you. Simply follow these steps:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Look for the right type of bets</li><li>Learn about the website's reputation</li><li>Test the waters</li></ol>
                        <div className="h3">Look For The Right Type Of Bets</div>
                        <p>No, we're not talking about the best odds, nor the ones that are&nbsp;<em>sure</em>&nbsp;to give you a win.</p>
                        <p>We're talking about the bets that fit your playstyle.</p>
                        <p>Are you in it to win it, or are you trying to amp up the fun by backing your favorite team?</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>If you're just <strong>looking to make a profit</strong>, then you want casinos with the&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/stake-bitcoin-casino-review/">best odds</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/cloudbet-bitcoin-casino-review/">largest number of choices</a>&nbsp;possible.</li><li>If you want to bet on a <strong>specific event or team</strong>, then you should guarantee those are available before you sign in.</li><li>If you're interested in <strong>something&nbsp;more niche</strong>, such as eSports or virtuals, you should go for a casino that specializes in them.</li></ul>
                        <div className="h3">Learn About The Website's Reputation</div>
                        <p>Every sportsbook is different, and some are more trustworthy than others. </p>
                        <p>When it comes to player safety, our number one tip is always the same: look for licensed websites (more on that below).</p>
                        <p>However, we also hold the community's opinion in high regard. If the general consensus is that the website is a bit shady, then it's probably better that you stay away from it.</p>
                        <p>You can look for information in the following places:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>Real user reviews.</li><li>Relevant forums (such as <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bitcointalk.org/" target="_blank">Bitcointalk</a>).</li><li>Expert reviews (such as <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/">ours</a>).</li></ul>
                        <div className="h3">See For Yourself</div>
                        <p>Several blockchain casinos let you play their slot machines for free and can even give you a <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/go/bitstarz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no deposit bonus</a> to try out their games in real mode.</p>
                        <p>You don't have such luck with bookmakers, but if <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/go/fortunejack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your chosen website also has a casino section with a no deposit bonus</a>, you can always give it a try. This way, you can at least get a good feel of the place before depositing your coin of choice.</p>
                        <p>If that's not an option, either because it's not available or you're not willing to play casino, you can always <strong>reach out to customer support</strong> and <strong>ask a few questions</strong>.</p>
                        <p>This way, you will know if they value their customers and if the support staff is friendly and knowledgeable.</p>

                                Reaching out to the customer support teams can prove quite rewarding. Not only will they let you know about any bonuses that you might have missed out on, but they can even offer you exclusive rewards you wouldn't know about otherwise!

                        <p>Yes, by now, you should know where to find a sportsbook where you can bet with cryptocurrencies.</p>
                        <p>However, you might still be on the fence. Maybe you're not sure if Bitcoin or other altcoins are your best bet (terrible pun intended).</p>

                        <div className="h3">Why Should You Do It?	</div>
                        <p>The most significant advantage of betting with cryptocurrencies is a very modern one - cyberprivacy.</p>
                        <p>Since there is no middle man, no bank or financial institution between you and your money, you don't have to share your personal details. </p>
                        <p>For the very same reason, the transaction costs are always lower, and the processing times are much speedier.</p>
                        <div className="w-full h-fit p-10  bg-cover rounded-lg" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backgroundImg}),radial-gradient(100% 100% at 100% 100%, #562d81 0%, #1d228e 100%)` }}>
                            <p className="text-sm  text-white opacity-50">MORE PRIVACY, LESS OF A HASSLE</p>
                            <div className="h2 text-white text-lg md:text-2xl">
                                Sports betting websites accepting cryptocurrencies also tend to be less demanding when it comes to their 'KYC' checks, which require you to share personal information before you can withdraw.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p className="mt-2">Since the transaction fees are smaller on their end as well, they can often offer a lower house margin, which allows them to provide better odds.</p>
                        <p>From another angle, cryptocurrency bonuses themselves tend to offer better value for money. </p>
                        <p>For instance, websites with a 1BTC bonus often have fiat equivalents where they just add three zeros to that number 1. And, of course, <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank">1BTC is worth much more than â‚¬1,000 or $1,000</a>. </p>
                        <p>To sum up, the advantages of cryptocurrency sports betting are:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>More privacy</li><li>Lower transaction fees</li><li>Faster transactions</li><li>More value for money on odds and bonuses</li></ul>

                        <p>Betting (in fact, doing <em>anything</em>) with cryptocurrencies certainly carries a risk.</p>
                        <p>Although Bitcoin bonuses are definitely more enticing than fiat bonuses, they do have one big drawback: their value fluctuates.</p>
                        <p>This volatility is valid for your earnings as well. A bet you place today can be worth much more or much less overnight. </p>
                        <p>Basically, <strong>Bitcoin betting can be thrilling and very rewarding</strong>, but it certainly <strong>isn't for the faint-hearted</strong>.</p>
                        <p>And since Bitcoin sports betting isn't for everyone, there are fewer websites supporting crypto payments. However, <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/new-paypal-crypto-wallet/">PayPal's new crypto wallet</a> will surely give you more options.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, not all countries accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender. This creates loopholes, where cryptocurrency betting is not considered gambling because it doesn't use 'real' money. In short, <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/are-crypto-casinos-legal/">crypto casinos may not be strictly legal</a> nor illegal, depending on where you live.</p>
