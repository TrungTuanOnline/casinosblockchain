                <p>Playing the lottery might be easy, but looking for a casino where you can play it with Bitcoin is anything but.</p>
                <p>Not only do you&nbsp;<strong>have to make sure there are enough games</strong>, but you should also&nbsp;<strong>look for a trusted website</strong>.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;Most importantly, you should look for a casino that suits your play-style.</p>
                <p>The following tips might help you make a decision:</p>
                <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Find out about the prize money.</li><li>Look at the casino's game portfolio.</li><li>Learn about the casino's reputation.</li></ol>
                <div className="h3">Find Out About The Prize Money</div>
                <p>Knowing how much you're expected to make is especially important when playing lottery games.</p>
                <p>However, the value of the said prize is relative. You should always also consider the following factors when picking a lottery game:</p>
                <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>The maximum and minimum bets.</li><li>The house edge.</li></ul>
                <p>For instance, a casino with a lower maximum prize but with a lower house edge could offer more value for money than one with an overall higher prize.</p>
                <div className="h3">Look At The Casino's Game Portfolio</div>
                <p>Lottery games are fun, but you might want to switch it up every once in a while.</p>
                <p>That's why it's always good to check what options you can have at your chosen casino before signing up.</p>
                <p>What's more, a casino with a larger game portfolio is more likely to a popular and trustworthy casino.</p>
                <div className="h3">Learn About The Casino's Reputation</div>
                <p>Only casinos with a verifiable license - especially those offering provably fair games - can be really reliable.</p>
                <p>Therefore, you should always confirm that the casino has a valid license before signing up.</p>
                <p>We also suggest you learn more about the casino's reputation within the blockchain casino's community:</p>
                <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>Read forum threads about the casino.</li><li>Look for user reviews.</li><li>Read professional reviews at sites like ours.</li></ul>
                <p>You can always <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/">check our list of reviewed casinos</a> to have a full picture of the casino before you give it a go.</p>

                    <p>Because Bitcoin lotteries are a relatively new invention, some blockchain technology newcomers might be wary to give it a go.</p>
                    <p>However, cryptocurrency gambling is not inherently riskier than playing with fiat money.</p>
                    <p>Basically, if you take the right steps to protect yourself when gambling with Bitcoin and other coins, you should be safe:</p>
                    <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Choose reputable casinos with valid gambling licenses. </li><li>If possible, play at provably fair lotteries.</li><li>Play responsibly and for fun.</li></ol>
                    <div className="h2">Game Rules	</div>
                <p>Everybody knows how to play the lottery:</p>
                <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>You buy a lottery ticket.</li><li>You pick a certain set of numbers (or have it already picked for you on the ticket).</li><li>You watch the numbers come out.</li><li>You win, or you lose.</li></ul>
                <p>Bitcoin lotteries and other online lotteries aren't any different. In fact, they might be the easiest of them all, since you can play from the comfort of your own house!</p>
                <p>If you're totally clueless about how lotteries work, just remember to <strong>compare the numbers on your ticket with the numbers that are drawn</strong>. </p>
                <p>Usually, you will need at least a few of the numbers on your ticket to match the drawn numbers for you to win anything.</p>
                <p>In an online casino, everything is automated, so the system will immediately tell you whether or not you've won.</p>
