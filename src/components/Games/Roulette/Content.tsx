                        </div>
                        <p>Here at Casinos Blockchain we take pride in our <strong>rigorous and comprehensive review process</strong>. We would never recommend a casino we don't personally play at - and love! </p>
                        <p>When we set out to find the best Bitcoin roulette casinos, we looked at a <strong>variety of factors</strong> including:</p>
                        <ul><li>The range of roulette games on offer</li><li>The quality of the software</li><li>Provable fairness</li><li>Welcome bonuses</li><li>Customer support and overall player experience</li></ul>
                        <p>Here is the <strong>exact step-by-step process</strong> we used to choose the top blockchain roulettes:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-dotted-list"><li><strong>We shortlisted casinos that accept crypto payments and have roulette games.</strong><br />We only included reputable gambling sites to this preliminary list. This means anyone with scam accusations or dubious licensing situation was out of the selection.</li><li><strong>We created accounts and deposited at all casinos to check the payment options and speed.</strong><br />We gave extra points if they had multiple cryptos, not just Bitcoin.</li><li><strong>We played the roulette games to see if the casino offers a fair and entertaining gambling experience.</strong><br />Admittedly, this was the most fun part of the review process. What can we say, we love our subject matter - that's why we're writing about it in the first place. </li><li><strong>We evaluated the customer support. <br /></strong>We wanted to see how helpful and professional the representatives are. Casinos with 24/7 support and multiple languages got extra points.</li><li><strong>We read the bonus terms and conditions. </strong><br />Bonuses are great, but only if the wagering requirements aren't ridiculous. We wanted to see if the offers are fair and achievable before we could recommend them.</li></ul>
                        <p>Finally, we looked for <strong>any other relevant information</strong> that could help us make the final decision. We love staying the loop with casinos, so this last step included checking their socials, reviews on Trust Pilot, the reputation on Bitcoin Talk and more. </p>
                        <p>And there you have it - our complete guide to the best blockchain roulette casinos! What did we find out? Read on...</p>

                        <p>There is also no physical roulette wheel, and the gameplay is fully digital:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>There is absolutely no human interaction, since the wheel is set in motion by a computer program. </li><li>The outcome of every spin is then generated by a random mathematical algorithm.</li><li>The result is visually reproduced using advanced graphics to give it a realistic sensation.</li></ol>
                        <p>Although the lack of a social component can be a drawback for some, there are some obvious advantages to this system:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>Since there is no human behind the game, it's <strong>harder to fake its results</strong>.</li><li>The game <strong>can be fully provably fair</strong>.</li></ul>

                            Bitcoin Roulette Dapps
                        </div>
                        <p>Dapps (or decentralized apps) are <strong>applications built on top of a blockchain network</strong>. They are decentralized because they run on a peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single central server. In practice, this means there is no single point of failure and no central authority that can control or shut down the app.</p>
                        <p>You also <strong>don't have to deposit money to the Dapp</strong> - instead, it connects to your crypto wallet and uses the tokens to play.</p>
                        <p><strong>So, are there any roulette Dapps?</strong></p>
                        <p>The good news - absolutely, there are. As the crypto gambling world grows, more and more Dapps are being created all the time.<br />The bad news - live roulette casinos don't exist on Dapps. If you're a fan of live dealer games, you'll have to stick to the regular online casinos for now.</p>
                        <p>Here are the most popular roulette Dapps that we love and are happy to recommend:</p>

It's built on the WAX blockchain and uses its own token, BET, for gambling.</p>
                        <p>The casino has a very <strong>user-friendly interface</strong>, and the games are easy to understand and play. The roulette table is well animated, with a <strong>straightforward betting process</strong> if a bit of a bleak design. The casino also has a other games, including slots, blackjack, and dice.</p>
                        <p>While EarnBet isn't as comprehensive as non-Dapp casinos, we love their <strong>low house edge and the provable fairness</strong>. Overall, it's a great option for anyone looking to gamble on a Dapp.</p>

                        <p>The site offers a wide variety of games, and the platform also has a <strong>nice social aspect to it</strong>. You can connect with other players and make friends, level up and earn rewards, and stay updated with the latest news.</p>

                        <p>As usually with Dapps, you will collect tokens (called 'Roy tokens') as you play, which will entitle you to a part of the game's dividends. Every hour, 1% of the dividend pool is distributed among players.   </p>

                            How to Get Started With Crypto Roulette?
                        </div>
                        <p>Ready to enjoy some roulette? Here is how to get started: </p>
                        <div className="h3">Choose Your Crypto</div>
                        <p>Since roulette is a fairly popular game, you'll find it at most crypto casinos. </p>
                        <p>The catch? Not all blockchain casinos are equal in terms of coin offering. If you stick to bigger cryptos (think BTC or ETH), you'll have plenty of options. </p>
                        <p>Some of the <strong>most popular cryptos</strong> for roulette games include:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_bubbles"><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-bitcoin-casinos/">Bitcoin</a></li><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-cash-casinos/">Bitcoin Cash</a></li><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/dogecoin-casinos/">Dogecoin</a></li><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a></li><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/litecoin-casinos/">Litecoin</a></li><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/tether-casinos/">Tether</a></li><li><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/ripple-casinos/">Ripple</a></li></ul>
                        <p><strong>Niche cryptos like <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/neo-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neo</a> and <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/cardano-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano</a></strong> are also sometimes available - but, far fewer casinos have them for sure. Plus, some gambling even have their own coin - e.g., True Flip's exclusive <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/true-flip-token-casinos/">True Flip Token</a>.</p>
                        <p>As for Dapps, the two most common cryptocurrencies you can play roulette with are Tron and EOS.</p>
                        <p><strong>Our two cents? </strong></p>
                        <p>Either <strong>pick a big cryptocurrency</strong> like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or <strong>play with a stablecoin </strong>like Tether. The latter is a particularly good option - <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/stablecoin-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stablecoins </a>remove most of the volatility associated with cryptocurrency.</p>
                        <div className="h3">Buy and Deposit Coins</div>
                        <p>Once you've picked your coin, it's time to go to an exchange and actually buy some. Our recommendations for exchanges include:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li><strong>Coinbase</strong>, which is super user-friendly and it's great for beginners</li><li><strong>Binance</strong>, easily the most popular exchange for more experienced crypto investors (it comes with lower fees, too)</li><li><strong>Kraken</strong>, one of the most secure exchanges that also boasts modest fees.</li></ul>
                        <p><strong>Most exchanges will require you to verify your identity by uploading a copy of your ID.</strong> Once you do that, you'll be able to deposit fiat money (e.g. USD, EUR) and exchange it for cryptocurrency. </p>
                        <p>This is known as a KYC or "Know Your Customer" process and you'll find it at most crypto casinos, too.</p>
                        <p>If you prefer to stay anonymous:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-dotted-list"><li><strong>Choose a no-KYC exchange like</strong> <strong>KuCoin and Bisq.</strong> Both of these are reputable (though not as big as Coinbase or Binance) and they don't require any identification - although KuCoin might implement a KYC if you're flagged with suspicious activity.</li><li>Play at a casino Dapp. Because Dapps are on the blockchain, they can connect to your waller directly and not ask for verification. However, this also means that you can't deposit or withdraw fiat currency.</li></ul>
                        <p><strong>Is it worth taking all those steps? That depends.</strong></p>
                        <p>For some people, NOT having anonymity defeats the purpose of using cryptos in the first place. For others, it's more important to have a wide choice of games and bonuses. </p>
                        <p>It's up to you to decide what you value more. But, one thing we can vouch for:</p>
                        <p><strong>KYC checks, when done right, aren't a danger to your privacy. </strong></p>
                        <p>There are safe KYC-implementing casinos and exchanges - as long as you stick to reputable providers and know the rules of the game. Which brings us to the next step:</p>

                            Learn the Game Rules
                        </div>
                        <p>Whether you play it at a regular casino, Dapp or Bitcoin casino, roulette is a simple game:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>You start by trying to guess on which box the ball will land after the wheel stops spinning.</li><li>Then, you place a bet on your best guess. You can even bet on multiple pockets.</li><li>When the ball stops, you either win or lose your bet.</li></ol>
                        <p>The complexity of the game lies in the different betting options available. These might seem confusing at first, but once you've got the hang of it, you will become a roulette pro in no time!</p>
                        <p>There are three main types of bets at a roulette table: inside bets, outside bets, and, for more experienced players, call bets.</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li><strong>Inside bets</strong> are placed on the colored and number tiles on the table you can see below. You can bet on single numbers, or by placing your token in between the lines that separate the tiles. </li><li><strong>Outside bets</strong> are placed outside the numbered grid. Famous roulette bets such as on black, red, odds, and evens are outside bets.</li><li><strong>Call bets</strong> are a bit more advanced. Players can bet on predefined sets of numbers, following a "race-track" map of the wheel, such as the Voisins du Zero, Orphelins, and Tiers.</li></ul>
                        <img src={EvoplayRoulette} alt="EvoplayRoulette" />
                        <p className="mt-4">That's it. You win the round if the ball lands on one of the numbers you picked. Of course, <strong>the fewer numbers you bet on, the higher the odds and the better the prize you can win</strong>.</p>
                        <div className="h3">What Is The Best Bitcoin Roulette Strategy?</div>
                        <p>Roulette is an ancient game, which means that many players tried their best to come up with winning strategies throughout the years. </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, <strong>there is no foolproof strategy for roulette at Bitcoin casinos or otherwise</strong>. This is, above all, a game of luck.</p>
                        <p>Just think about it: if it were possible to come up with a guaranteed way to win it, casinos woud've stopped offering roulette games a long time ago!</p>

                        <p> The following tips might help you get started.</p>
                        <div className="h3">How Do You Like To Play?</div>
                        <p>Are you in it to win it, or are you playing mostly for fun? </p>
                        <p>In case the first option appeals to you, look for casinos that offering <strong>as many betting options as possible</strong>. This way, you can try different methods and see what works best for you. </p>
                        <p>If you are a fun-loving player, it might be a good idea to go for the <strong>casinos with the best bonuses</strong>. These will buy you extra playing time. Just make sure you are aware of all terms and conditions before sealing the deal.&nbsp;</p>
                        <div className="h3">Go Through Online Reviews</div>
                        <p>Every casino is different, and some casinos are more table game friendly than others. </p>
                        <p>That's why it's a good idea to read online reviews, both by experts and casual users. These reviewers have tested the casinos before writing, so you don't have to. They can give you a pretty good idea of the pros and cons of the casinos and Dapps.</p>
                        <p>If you're reading real user reviews, just keep in mind that people can be biased by their own experiences, and might give positive or negative reviews because they won big or lost big, respectively.</p>
                        <div className="h3">See For Yourself</div>
                        <p>After you join a casino, you don't have to make a deposit right away. </p>
                        <p>You can just look around in the live casino, join a Live Roulette game, and even chat with a few players to see if you like the ambiance.</p>
                        <p> It's also a good idea to test the customer support. Open the live chat (if it exists) and ask a few questions. After all, you need to play somewhere you'll be valued.</p>

                            Tips For Beginners
                        </div>
                        <p>It can seem overwhelming to start as a new Roulette player, so that's why we're wrapping it up with some final tips:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-dotted-list"><li><strong>Safety first</strong>. <br />Gamble responsibly by setting a budget, only playing when sober, and sticking to licensed casinos and provably fair Dapps. These tips will protect you and keep the game fun.</li><li><strong>Explore your game style. </strong><br />As a beginner, it's a good idea to try different things. Start with outside bets, as the odds for you are higher than with inside bets. Some people say it is better to stick to the same bet during one sitting, but this is not proven. It's ok to get familiar with roulette betting strategies such as Martingale, D'Alembert, and Labouchere, but remember that there's no guaranteed way to win.</li><li><strong>Maximise your earnings.</strong><br />Some people suggest sticking to European roulettes for the lower house edge (compared to American). Make sure you always follow the casino rules, too. If asked for KYC information, provide it and don't lie - these could become reason to get banned. And, while there are no guaranteed wins, remember that cashing out on time (when you're still not tired or frustrated) and not chasing losses are essential to keep this healthy. </li></ul>
                        <p>Last but not least, <strong>don't forget to have fun. </strong>Whether that means trying different roulette games, checking out some live tables, or getting social in the player's chat, this is supposed to be fun - keep it that way!</p>

Roulette is a game of pure chance, and there is no formula that can predict the outcome of every spin. However, you do have better odds at European roulette games.
