                        <p>With more and more <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/">blockchain casinos</a> offering Bitcoin jackpots, these games are becoming increasingly easy to find. </p>
                        <p>However, not at casinos offer the same kind of jackpots, with some specializing in one type of game. </p>
                        <p>That's why it's important to make a distinction between the following type of jackpot games:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_bubbles"><li>Jackpot Slots</li><li>Dice Jackpots</li><li>Roulette Jackpots</li><li>Special Jackpots</li></ul>

                            Bitcoin Jackpot Slots
                        </div>
                        <p>Jackpot slots are, by far, the most popular and widespread of all Bitcoin jackpots.</p>
                        <p>In fact, nearly every single&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-bitcoin-casinos/">Bitcoin casino</a>&nbsp;offers at least one version of this highly-rewarding casino game, often more. The only exceptions tend to be&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-gambling-dapps/">casino Dapps</a>&nbsp;or highly-specialized casinos (such as Primedice) that don't have slot machines at all.</p>
                        <p>These popular games are, for the most part, thrilling experiences due to their extremely volatile nature. They <strong>don't pay out regularly, but when they do, they can break the bank</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Jackpot slots come in two different flavors: fixed jackpots and progressive jackpots.</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li><strong>Fixed jackpots</strong>&nbsp;are special prizes with lower odds and higher payouts than a regular win.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before you can trigger them, you often have to complete a specific task, such as collecting jackpot symbols or finishing a bonus round.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although we call them&nbsp;<em>fixed&nbsp;</em>jackpots, their value often depends on the size of your bet. <strong>Higher stakes will trigger higher jackpots</strong>.</li><li><strong>Progressive jackpots</strong> are also special prizes, although their value is always changing.<br /><br />Every time a player places a bet on the game and doesn't win the jackpot, <strong>part of the stake goes into the prize pool</strong>. <br /><br />Consequently, the <em>progressive</em> jackpot increases with every spin. Since this applies to all players from all casinos offering the game, <strong>the jackpot can be astronomical</strong>.</li></ol>

                            The record for the highest win on a progressive jackpot slot currently stands at â‚¬18.9 million, and it was won on Microgaming's infamous <i>Mega Moolah</i>.

                        <p>It's important to note that, despite their appeal, jackpot slots (particularly if progressive) have one significant drawback:&nbsp;<strong>their prizes are often in fiat money</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Regardless, you can play them at many blockchain casinos with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a>.</p>

                        <p>Let's have a closer look at why we chose this old-timer as the ultimate dice casino where you can win a jackpot.</p>
                        <img src={PrimediceLogo} alt="PrimediceLogo" />
                        <p>Primedice is, arguably, the world's best dice casino. This is no bold claim: <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5296222.0" target="_blank">the opinion is shared</a> by many players and casino professionals alike.</p>
                        <p>Let's have a look at why Primedice is such a great choice:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - there are no other games to distract you, no promotions (except for a VIP club), nor a fancy design. There's just a simple yet excellent dice game.<br /><strong>Reputation</strong> - established in 2013, Primedice is one of the oldest Bitcoin casinos around, and it's kept a pristine reputation throughout all those years.</li><li><strong>Community</strong> - the casino's chat, live winner's feed, and active forum help bring a social element to the lonely act of gambling online while safeguarding your privacy at all times, of course.</li></ul>
                        <p>The cherry on top of the cake is Primedice's progressive jackpot. Since Primedice has a large player base, it's often at high values.</p>
                        <p>This Bitcoin jackpot is relatively straightforward: to win it,&nbsp;<strong>you need to roll 77.77 twice in a row</strong>.</p>
                        <p>However, only players with bets above 0.01 BTC will win the full jackpot. Lower stakes will only win a share of the prize pool, which can go as low as 1%.</p>

Let's take a closer look at two of them: <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/king-billy-casino-review/">King Billy</a> and <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/crypto-games-review/">Crypto Games</a>.</p>

                        <p>Any bet on a single number can trigger the titular <em>Fire Blaze</em> round, where four different fixed jackpots are up for grabs.</p>
                         <p className="mt-3"><em>Mega Fire Blaze Roulette</em> is also the roulette jackpot game you can find at <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bao-casino-review/">Bao Casino</a>.

                         <p className="mt-4">Crypto Games offers a progressive cryptocurrency jackpot that you can win while playing the casino's provably fair roulette or dice game.</p>
                         <p>To win it when playing roulette, you must meet the following conditions:</p>
                         <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>You must roll 7 four times in a row with the same cryptocurrency.</li><li>All bets must be profitable.</li></ol>
                         <p>Just like with Primedice's Bitcoin jackpot, you need a bet above a certain amount (depending on your chosen cryptocurrency) to win the full prize pool. Lower stakes will only earn a share of the jackpot, which can be as low as 1%.</p>

                        <p>Special jackpots are Bitcoin jackpots that don't fit any of the categories mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>Most commonly, you have to win a ticket draw to win the jackpot. You can collect the tickets when playing at the casino.</p>
                        <p>For the most part, these jackpots are&nbsp;<strong>exclusive to cryptocurrency casinos</strong>&nbsp;and, especially,&nbsp;<strong>gambling Dapps</strong>. These are the very best:</p>

                        <p className="mt-4">If you ever had a look at our <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/trueflip-casino-review/">True Flip review</a>, you won't be surprised it's our number one pick for special cryptocurrency jackpots. Similarly, it's certainly not the first time <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/earnbet-review/">EarnBet</a> managed to top our lists when it comes to gambling Dapps.</p>
                        <p>Let's learn a bit more about their special Bitcoin jackpots.</p>
                        <img src={TrueFlipBanner} alt="TrueFlipBanner" />
                        <p>True Flip's jackpot rewards loyalty: <strong>the more you play</strong> the casino's games, <strong>the better are your chances</strong> of winning it!</p>
                        <p>Here's how you can participate:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Opt in to the Flip's Star program.</li><li>Play games. Any games will do.</li><li>Accumulate Flip points as you play along.</li><li>Receive tickets from your points.</li><li>Participate in the ticket draw for a chance to win the jackpot.</li></ol>
                        <p>Besides the weekly Bitcoin jackpot, there are other rewards with more modest prizes up for grabs. </p>
                        <img src={EarnbetCasino} alt='EarnbetCasino' />
                        <p className="mt-4">Similar to True Flip's Bitcoin jackpot, EarnBet rewards you with a chance to win a jackpot when you play its games. </p>
                        <p>However, the fun takes place at a separate mini-game. Here's how it goes:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Bet over 0.000001 BTC on any of this Dapp's games.</li><li>Buy a jackpot token with an additional 0.00002 BTC wager.</li><li>Roll a 7,777,777 to win the game - and take home the progressive jackpot!</li></ol>
                        <p>Do note that the full amount of the ticket price goes into the jackpot's prize pool. This means that this casino Dapp's infamous BET tokens are not collected when playing the jackpot game.</p>

                            Choosing the Right Bitcoin Jackpot Casino
                        </div>
                        <p>If you read this far, you should know where you can find the best Bitcoin jackpot casinos by now.</p>
                        <p>Any of the choices listed above are great options, but deciding which one is <em>the one</em> for you is a different story. </p>
                        <p>Luckily, there are a few things you can always keep in mind when choosing the best Bitcoin casino where you can play jackpot games:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Choose your style of Bitcoin jackpot</li><li>Pick reputable casinos</li><li>Consider other games and features</li><li>Put it to the test</li></ol>
                        <div className="h3">Choose Your Style of Bitcoin Jackpot</div>
                        <p>As we've covered before, dice jackpots and special jackpots are more common at specialized Bitcoin casinos and gambling Dapps. Similarly, jackpot slots are more readily available at more mainstream websites with thousands of games.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this means you are&nbsp;<strong>unlikely to find more than one type of Bitcoin jackpot game at the same casino</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Because of this, before you seriously consider signing up at a new casino, you should decide which game is more important to you.</p>
                        <p>Are you looking for more regular payouts or that once-in-a-lifetime jackpot that might change your life?</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>If you're interested in more <strong>casual casino jackpots</strong> that pay out regularly, then you should head on out to <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/go/true-flip/" target="_blank">casinos that have jackpot draws</a>.</li><li>If you're really looking for <strong>life-changing jackpots</strong>,  then your best bet is a <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/go/bitstarz/" target="_blank">more mainstream casino</a>.</li><li>If you want <strong><a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/provably-fair-gambling/">provably fair</a> jackpots</strong>, then look for <a className="text-blue-700" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/go/primedice/" data-type="URL" data-id="/go/primedice/" target="_blank">dice jackpots</a> and gambling Dapps.</li></ul>
                        <div className="h3">Pick Reputable Casinos</div>
                        <p>If there's something you should make sure before you sign up at any casino is that it's&nbsp;<strong>reputable&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>safe</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Our rule-of-thumb for this type of game is the same as always:&nbsp;<strong>prefer licensed casinos</strong>.</p>
                        <p>What's more, you can - and should - try to learn as much about the casino as possible. You can look for information in the following places:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>Real user reviews.</li><li>Industry forums (such as Bitcointalk).</li><li>Expert reviews (such as ours).</li></ul>
                        <div className="h3">Consider Other Games And Features</div>
                        <p>There is more to Bitcoin casinos than jackpot games, and it may come the day when you want to try something new.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, it's always a good idea to choose&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" target="_blank" href="/go/kingbilly-casino/" rel="noreferrer noopener">casinos that have many games</a>, or even casinos&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" target="_blank" href="/go/stake/" rel="noreferrer noopener">also offering a sportsbook</a>.</p>
                        <p>Other important aspects to consider are the amount and value of the promotions that are available for you.</p>
                        <div className="h3">Put The Casino To The Test</div>
                        <p>The only way to know for sure if a casino is a right match for your playstyle is to try it first-hand.</p>
                        <p>The best part? <strong>You can do it without risking your hard-earned Bitcoin</strong>. Here's how:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li>Contact customer support and ask a few questions. If they are helpful and knowledgeable, you know you're in the right place.</li><li>Play in 'play for free' mode. This way, you can get a feel for the jackpot games even before signing up.</li><li>Look for casinos with <a href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-no-deposit-bonuses/">no deposit bonuses</a>, which allow you to play and win for free before making your first deposit.</li></ol>

                            Reaching out to the customer support teams can prove quite rewarding. Not only will they let you know about any bonuses that you might have missed out on, but they can even offer you exclusive rewards you wouldn't know about otherwise!

                            Bitcoin Jackpots - Pros And Cons
                        </div>
                        <p>So far, we've covered what Bitcoin jackpots are, where you can play them, and which casinos you should choose.</p>
                        <p>However, we haven't addressed one crucial issue:&nbsp;<strong>why you should play jackpots at blockchain casinos instead of fiat money casinos</strong>.</p>
                        <p>There are certainly benefits and disadvantages to both. Let's have a look at them.</p>

                        <div className="h3">Why Should You Do It?</div>
                        <p>Slots, sports bets, jackpots, live casino games may be very different, but there is one advantage of cryptocurrency gambling that is common to all: cyberprivacy.</p>
                        <p>Only at Bitcoin casinos - or casinos offering other cryptos - can you truly protect your privacy.</p>
                        <p>This is true for many reasons&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/anonymous-bitcoin-casinos/">that we've covered before</a>. The most relevant is that&nbsp;<strong>there is no middle man</strong>: at a blockchain casino, all transactions can be processed directly between the casino and you, with no need for a third-party like a bank or government.</p>
                        <p>Not only does this give you more privacy, but it also&nbsp;<strong>reduces processing fees</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>improves processing times</strong>, which are often instant.</p>

                            <p className="text-sm  text-white opacity-50">KYC BE GONE!</p>
                            <div className="h2 text-white text-lg md:text-2xl">
                            Bitcoin jackpot casinos and, especially, gambling Dapps are less demanding when it comes to their 'KYC' checks, which require you to share personal information before you can withdraw.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p className="mt-4">What's more, cryptocurrency casinos have lower operational costs, which means they&nbsp;<strong>can give you improved house edges and better bonuses</strong>&nbsp;across the board.</p>
                        <p>Just think about it. What would you rather receive - a&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1000 bonus or one worth 1BTC</a>?</p>
                        <p>In a nutshell, this is&nbsp;<strong>why you should</strong>&nbsp;<strong>play Bitcoin jackpots</strong>&nbsp;over fiat jackpots:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_bubbles"><li>More privacy</li><li>Lower transaction fees</li><li>Faster transactions</li><li>More value for money on odds and bonuses</li></ul>

                        <p>Cryptocurrencies can be fun and rewarding, but they come with an inherent risk: value fluctuations.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you deposit with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - except stablecoins - you are, in a way, gambling. Why? Because your deposit may increase or decrease in worth overnight.</p>
                        <p>This can be seen as an advantage - you&nbsp;<em>may</em>&nbsp;end up with a much more valuable deposit,&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-over-20k-blockchain-casinos/">especially if the market is on the rise</a>&nbsp;- but it certainly isn't for everyone.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, and for regulatory reasons as well,&nbsp;<strong>not all casinos offer Bitcoin jackpots</strong>. What's more, cryptocurrency casinos are often less regulated than their fiat counterparts.</p>
                        <div className="w-full h-fit p-10  bg-cover rounded-lg" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backgroundImg}),radial-gradient(100% 100% at 100% 100%, #562d81 0%, #1d228e 100%)` }}>

                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_bubbles"><li>Currency fluctuations</li><li>Fewer websites</li><li>Laxer regulation</li></ul>
                        <p>As you can see, there are more advantages than drawbacks.</p>
                        <p>We also believe that none of the disadvantages are necessarily negative. Currency fluctuations, for instance, are just an added plus for thrill-seekers out there.</p>

                        <p>Have you never played a Bitcoin jackpot before? These tips might be helpful:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>Don't bet more than you can spend - always set a budget and don't go over it.</li><li>Always start small - before you become a high roller, try placing lower bets.</li><li>When playing a progressive jackpot, wait for when it's over its theoretical drop rate - it's more likely to drop then.</li><li>If playing a jackpot slot, pick one with a higher RTP.</li><li>Don't forget: jackpot slots, dice, and roulettes have other prizes that you can win!</li><li>Take advantage of bonuses and other rewards that can give you an ace up your sleeve.</li><li>Play with common currencies before venturing into altcoins.</li><li>Always play at trusted casinos and Dapps, preferably with a license.</li><li>Play for fun - don't see Bitcoin jackpots as an alternative to mining Bitcoin.</li></ul>
