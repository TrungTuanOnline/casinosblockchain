    <p>There are two main types of gambling sites to check out: </p>
    <div className="h3">Online Casinos</div>
    <p>Cryptocurrency-friendly casinos are on the rise. They're <strong>getting bigger, accepting more cryptos</strong> (if you want to branch out from Bitcoin live games to altcoins), and offering more and more <strong>generous payouts</strong>. </p>
    <p>Since the overhead costs of running an online crypto casino are lower, these sites can afford <strong>lower house edges and higher RTPs</strong>, too. </p>
    <p>Here are our top three casinos for live games with Bitcoin: </p>

<p className="mt-2">Online casinos are fun and all, but hardcore decentralization supporters might still have one major issues with them: </p>
<p><strong>There is still one central company controlling the site. </strong></p>
<p>All the casinos we recommend are reputable and licensed. Still, on principle, blockchain enthusiasts might prefer a decentralized option. </p>
<p>Does that exist? Absolutely!</p>
<p>Check out our favorite Bitcoin live casino Dapps: </p>
<div className="h3">Dapps - Decentralized Applications With Live Casino</div>
<p>As things stand, Live Casinos are more still far more common with traditional casinos. It's true that there aren't many Dapps available that offer Live Casino games - but that doesn't mean they don't exist. </p>
<p>Here are our two favorite live game Dapps: </p>

	<div className="h2">Live Casino Games With Other Cryptocurrencies	</div>
    <p>As more and more crypto casinos begin to offer Bitcoin live casino games, a growing number also <strong>embraces altcoins</strong>. Here are the cryptos you can expect to find at different types of gambling sites: </p>
    <div className="h3">Casino</div>
    <p>At the moment you can <strong>play with most cryptocurrencies</strong> in casinos that offer Live Casino games. </p>
    <p>Big-name coins like <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-bitcoin-casinos/">Bitcoin</a>, <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/best-ethereum-casinos/">Ethereum</a>, <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-cash-casinos/">Bitcoin Cash</a> and <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/litecoin-casinos/">Litecoin</a> are almost always available. Even better, anti-volatility stablecoins like Tether are also increasingly beginning to appear, which is great for more risk-averse players. </p>
    <div className="h3">Dapps</div>
    <p>Most Dapps that offer Live Casino games used to only be available for Tron players. Thankfully, BetFury has changed that and you can now enjoy a <strong>range of altcoins on Dapps</strong>, too.  </p>

<section id="which-live-casino-games">
	<div className="h2">Which Live Casino Games Can I Play With Bitcoin?	</div>
    <p>Most of the Live Casino games include versions of the well-known <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/roulette-bitcoin-casino/">roulette</a>, <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/blackjack-bitcoin-casino/">blackjack</a>, <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-baccarat/">baccarat </a>and <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-poker-sites/">poker</a> games, but there are also new games available that are invented especially for the casino. </p>
    <p>Read on to learn how the games differ from the regular casino versions.</p>
    <div className="h3">Live Roulette</div>
    <p>What's nice about Live Roulette is that you can find the game in many different languages and more are being added as we speak. </p>
    <p>This means that if you're not a native English speaker, there's a good chance the live dealer speaks your language and you won't be forced to play in English.</p>
    <img src={LiveRoulette} alt="LiveRoulette" />
    <p className="mt-2">Other than that, there are special VIP tables for high rollers and tables for players with a lower budget. If you sit on the right table, you'll always be able to chat with players of your caliber.</p>
    <p>There are also special versions of the game available, like for example Lightning Roulette. </p>
    <p>This game offers all the regular bets and extra options to win such as Lucky Numbers and Lucky Payouts. Check out this exciting table at BC.Game: </p>

    </div>
    <div className="h3">Live Blackjack</div>
    <p>The live versions of blackjack, include the standard games with a dealer, but you'll also be able to find many other versions of the game.</p>
    <p>Take Blackjack Common Draw for example, this game by <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/netent-bitcoin-casinos/">NetEnt</a> allows for an unlimited number of players to play with the same cards. </p>

    <img src={NetEntLiveBlackjack} alt="NetEntLiveBlackjack" />
    <p>During this game you can see exactly what other are doing when in your shoes and maybe learn from their tactics.</p>
    <p>There are also many VIP options for high rollers looking to play Live Blackjack in a more private setting.</p>

    </div>
    <div className="h3">Live Baccarat</div>
    <p>When it comes to baccarat there are innumerous possibilities as well, ranging from punto banco to baccarat Macau. The last option offers a way to play the game in the true Asian style.</p>
    <img src={EvolutionGamingMultiCamera} alt="EvolutionGamingMultiCamera" />
<p className="mt-2">Another great option is Multi Camera Baccarat by Evolution Gaming. This game shows you various angles of the table and makes you feel like you are actually in the studio with the dealer.</p>

</div>

<div className="h3">Live Poker</div>
<p>The poker game at a Live Casino is not quite the same as regular poker. Here you play against the dealer and need to beat the dealer's hand. Normally the Texas Hold'em rules are being followed.</p>
<img src={LiveCasinoHoldem} alt="LiveCasinoHoldem" />
<p className="mt-2">But you can also find other poker versions in the Live Casino, like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and much more. The only thing all versions have in common is that you play against a dealer.</p>
<p>Just be aware that Live Casino Poker is less common in Bitcoin casinos than in regular casinos. You can find Live Casino Hold'em at <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/fortunejack-bitcoin-casino-review/">FortuneJack</a>, but not all blockchain casinos that offer a Live Casino offer the same games.</p>

<div className="h3">Other Games</div>
<p>Nowadays more and more games are being invented to keep the Live Casino as exciting as possible. </p>
<img src={EvolutionDreamCatcher} alt="EvolutionDreamCatcher" />
<p className="mt-2">Some examples include Dream Catcher, where the dealer spins a big wheel, Football Studio, where there's a real sports commentator in a studio and Deal or no deal, where you get to re-enact the popular game show. </p>
<p>Most of the Bitcoin casinos with a bigger Live Casino like Stake and BC.Game, offer at least two of these games.</p>

	<div className="h2">How To Choose the Best Bitcoin Casino For Live Casino Games	</div>
    <p>Playing Live Casino games is fun, but they still involve monetary movements so you need to pick a <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/">crypto casino</a> that you can trust. Read the following tips if you need some guidance on what to look for.</p>
<div className="h3">Choose Which Games Are Most Important to You</div>
<p>Before you can choose a casino, it's important to know which games you want to play. It seems obvious, but with all the extras casinos offer nowadays, it's easy to forget that you go there for the games.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the biggest offer and variety in games, a casino that offers games by Evolution Gaming is definitely recommended. </p>
<p>Some examples of crypto casinos that offers these games are <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/trueflip-casino-review/">True Flip</a>, BitStarz and (of course) BC.Game.</p>
<p>You can try games in the casino version for free and then decide which you definitely want to play and which you don't particularly care for. Once you know this, it's easy to verify if the casino can live up to your demand.</p>
<div className="h3">Check Out Some Games Before Playing</div>
<p>While it's not possible to try out Live Casino games for free in demo mode, you can still login to a casino and open a game before depositing. </p>
<p>This way you can see how a live game actually works and if you like the dealer at that particular table.</p>
<p>You are also free to switch tables as much as you want, so don't hesitate to do so.</p>
<div className="h3">Use a Bonus to Start Playing</div>
<p>If you are still hesitant to start playing with your own money, you can always look for a casino that offers a nice welcome bonus and regular promotions. </p>
<p>BC.Game is our favorite BTC casino for a reason - it has some titillating bonuses like the Lucky Spin. Best of all, the spins are completely free. You get a chance to win one entire Bitcoin every day - simply for signing up!</p>
