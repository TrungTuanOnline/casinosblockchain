                            What Are Bitcoin Free Spins?
                        </div>
                        <p>If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of free spins, it’s pretty straightforward: <strong>you get extra spins on a slot machine for free.</strong>  You can then use the free spins to play the game without spending your own money. </p>
                        <div className="w-full h-[200px] flex px-10 jusitfy-center items-center  bg-cover rounded-lg" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backgroundImg}),radial-gradient(100% 100% at 100% 100%, #562d81 0%, #1d228e 100%)` }}>
                            <div className="h2 text-white text-lg md:text-2xl">
                                Even though you’re playing “for free,” the potential prizes are real and they’re yours to keep.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p className="mt-10">Plenty of online casinos offer free spins to draw in new players or as a fun reward for their regulars. Just search for “free spins” in casino reviews and you’ll realize how common the bonus is.</p>
                        <p><strong>Free spins are often tied to a particular game </strong>, meaning you can’t just spend them willy-nilly. The slot is usually specified in the promotional materials for the bonus – for the most part, it’s a game that the casino wants to promote.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bitcoin casino free spins aren’t any different than regular free spins, but most players withdraw in BTC (or mBTC, mili-bitcoin) instead of cash.</strong> Some <a className="text-blue-600" href="/best-bitcoin-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin casinos</a> also have gameplay with fiat money, meaning you could get any prizes you win in cash or crypto. </p>
                        <p>The result is the same:</p>
                        <div className="w-full h-[200px] flex px-10 jusitfy-center items-center  bg-cover rounded-lg" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backgroundImg}),radial-gradient(100% 100% at 100% 100%, #562d81 0%, #1d228e 100%)` }}>

                                Bitcoin free spins give you free rounds – and, if you’re lucky, you can win extra coin.

                        <p className="mt-10">Does it sound too good to be true? There is a catch and it’s called wagering requirements. </p>
                        <p><strong>Virtually all free spin offers have wagering requirements (also known as play-through requirements) that you need to complete before you can withdraw any winnings. </strong></p>
                        <p>Wagering requirements can help you evaluate if a free spin offer is worth it – the lower they are, the better.</p>
                        <p>Let’s break them down:</p>
                        <div className="h3">
                            What Are Wagering Requirements?
                        </div>
                        <p>Invariably, if you win from Bitcoin free spins, the prize is yours to keep. Wagering requirements are the fine print of this otherwise pretty sweet offer .</p>
                        <p>Wagering requirements (or rollover) exist <a className="text-blue-600" href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across casinos and sports betting sites</a>. They require you to play through your winnings a pre-defined amount of times before you can withdraw them. </p>
                        <p><strong>While you have the money in your account, you must spend it multiple times over at the casino to cash out.</strong></p>
                        <p>Check out a real-life example – <a className="text-blue-600" href="/trueflip-casino-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">True Flip’s</a> Citizen ID bonus, which includes 30 free spins :</p>
                        <img src={trueflip2} className="w-full h-auto" alt="FreeSpinImage" />
                        <p className="mt-4">The cool thing about this offer is it doesn’t require a deposit. <strong>All you have to do is sign up for True Flip and complete your profile. The free spins are a gift, but you get to keep anything you win. </strong></p>
                        <p className="my-4">Here’s how playing and withdrawing would look like: </p>
                        <ul className="is-style-dotted-list"><li><strong>You register </strong>and fill up your profile. </li><li><strong>True Flip gives you 30 free spins </strong>at the <em>Day and Night</em> slot. </li><li><strong>You play and win 1 mBTC</strong>, the money gets credited to your account. </li><li><strong>Since the wagering requirement is x1</strong>, you’ll have to play through one more mBTC to cash out. You have two options here: <br />a) You gamble with what you earned. If you get lucky, you make some money on your bets and you have leftover to cash out.<br />b) You deposit one more mBTC and play with that. </li><li><strong>Now you’ve placed bets for x1 your free spin earnings </strong>and True Flip allows you to cash out. </li></ul>
                        <p>Is it worth it, then? It depends. There are two things that can happen:</p>
                        <p>? <strong>You play and turn the wagering requirement into a much bigger, fully withdrawable prize. </strong>Yay! You’re free to cash out and enjoy your earnings. </p>
                        <p>? <strong>You bet according to the wagering requirement. Unfortunately, you lose the money. </strong>It’s a shame, but you still got to enjoy the games for longer without spending extra cash.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the day, it’s all a matter of luck.</p>
                        <p>The key here is to see free spins as a <strong>way to extend your fun, which may lead to an awesome prize</strong> in the end!</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that this only applies to promotional free spins. Free spins that you can win during a normal game round don’t include wagering requirements (unless you won them while playing with bonus money).</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Now, the good news is most of those casinos offer <em>multiple </em>free spin offers – not just one. To give you the best free spins offers, we’ve broken them down into:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li><strong>Best Signup Spins </strong>– casinos offer these as a no deposit bonus, just for signing up.</li><li><strong>Best First Deposit Spins</strong> – a lot of gambling sites include free spins in their welcome package.</li><li><strong>Best Tournament Free Spins</strong> – these are tournament prize free spins. </li></ul>
                        <p>Let’s dig a bit deeper into some of these offers. You can also read our <a className="text-blue-600" href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain casino reviews</a> for more information about each brand, including an overview of each promotion.</p>

                            No Deposit Free Spins
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Some casinos give you free spins simply for signing up.</strong> They’re a great way to try out new online casinos and games without having to put any of your own money on the line. </p>
                        <p>Here are our favorite offers in this category, compared side-by-side:</p>
                        <figure className="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table className="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Casino</strong></td><td><strong>Free Spins</strong></td><td><strong>Requirements?</strong></td><td><strong>Wagering</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a className="text-blue-600" href="/go/bc-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BC.Game</a></td><td>1 (daily)</td><td>Sign up (no KYC)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><a className="text-blue-600" href="/go/true-flip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">True Flip</a></td><td>30</td><td>Sign up (including KYC)</td><td>1x</td></tr><tr><td><a className="text-blue-600" href="/go/bitstarz/">BitStarz</a></td><td>20</td><td>Sign up (no KYC)</td><td>40x</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
                        <p className="mt-4">As you can see, <strong>some no deposit free spins don’t require a KYC</strong> (Know Your Consumer) check – all you have to do is create a username and password. This can be extremely useful for players who want to gamble with a particular casino and don’t want to waste any time with a lengthy registration process. </p>
                        <p><strong>However,  keep in mind that these casinos can still ask for a KYC before a withdrawal.</strong></p>
                        <p>This is why you should never lie about your ID or location – because you’d fail the KYC and never see your earnings anyway. </p>
                        <p>Identity confirmation aside, the wagering requirements are the other major hitch with free spins. Since BC.Game’s daily lucky spin has no wagering requirements and no strings attached, it’s no wonder they take first place in this category. Check them out and try your luck at the wheel today: </p>

                        <p>Bitcoin casino bonuses are the most popular way of attracting new users , but vary from provider to provider. </p>
                        <p><strong>Some Bitcoin casinos give you free spins, along with matching your first deposit</strong>. Let’s compare the most popular offers in that category:</p>

                        <p>As you can see, there is a wider range of first desposit spin terms and conditions. </p>
                        <p>At first glance, King Billy’s offer seems the best – they have the lowest minimum deposit and wagering requirements and the number of free spins is decent. And, while King Billy is our top pick in this category, there is one thing to keep in mind: </p>
                        <p><strong>Free spins are released in increments. </strong></p>
                        <p className="mt-28">When you first sign up, you get 50 free spins (along with the deposit match.) Then, 23 hours later they add 50 more spins – but only if you made at least 1x wager of your deposit amount. Then, you get two more packs of 50 for the next few days. </p>
                        <p>While this is a solid deal, if you don’t play immediately, you miss out. </p>

                        <p>As we’ve mentioned before, there are two main types of free spins at Bitcoin casinos:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>Free spins that you win during normal game rounds</li><li>Free spins given to you by the casino</li></ul>
                        <p>They are in many ways similar – both give you extra rounds “on the house,” allowing you to win Bitcoin without spending your own coin – but there are a few differences. Let’s compare them!</p>

                        <p>The casino will give you a chance to play a new or popular slot game without having to deposit any money. </p>
                        <p><strong>No deposit free spins are a fantastic way to try out online slots.</strong> You can use them to play popular slots and most of these bonuses also offer a decent chance to win some money.</p>
                        <p>In this section, we will look into the main advantages and disadvantages of deposit and no deposit free spins, as well as introduce you to other promotional offers.</p>
                        <div className="h3">No Deposit Free Spins</div>
                        <p><strong>No deposit free spins are awarded free of charge</strong>, usually to new players that have just opened an account with the casino.</p>
                        <p>Their main advantage, of course, is that they let you play at the casino without risking your own Bitcoin! Here are the perks you get with a no deposit free spin: </p>
                        <p>✔️ You don’t have to make any deposit to receive the free spins </p>
                        <p>✔️ You can play with the spins right away </p>
                        <p>✔️ If you win, your winnings are yours to keep (subject to wagering requirements) </p>
                        <p>There are, however, a few things to keep in mind with no deposit free spins:</p>
                        <p>❌ They often require you to verify your account first, so they aren’t ideal if you’d rather not give personal data.</p>
                        <p>❌ Wagering requirements are likely to be very steep, often at least 40x (there is an exception here and we’ll talk about it).</p>
                        <p>❌ They are usually only available on a specific game or set of games.</p>
                        <p>❌ Expect individual free spins to have relatively low values plus a cap on winnings.</p>
                        <p>In the end, no deposit free spins are <strong>better suited for those looking to try out a new casino</strong>, and are not a sustainable long term deal. Even so, some no deposit free spins are better than others.</p>
                        <p><strong>? What No Deposit Free Spins Are Out There?</strong></p>
                        <p>Our absolute favorite no deposit free spin is <strong>BC.Game’s daily wheel spin</strong>. You get one try at the Lucky Spin! promo every day – and you could win up to 1 BTC with no requirements (!), other than having a profile on BC.Game:</p>
                        <img src={BcgameSpin} className="w-full h-auto" alt="FreeSpinsImage" />
                        <p className="my-10">Another excellent no deposit free spin is <strong>True Flip’s Citizen ID bonus</strong>. You get 30 free spins at the Day and Night slot by TrueLabs just for registering with the casino and verifying your identity. </p>
                        <img src={trueflip3} className="w-full h-auto" alt="FreeSpinsImage" />
                        <p className="mt-3">Plus, the True Flip wagering requirements are also very fair at just x1.</p>

                            Welcome Bonus Free Spins
                        </div>
                        <p>Perhaps the most common type of free spins at Bitcoin casinos are the ones in welcome packages – e.g., what you get at mBit.</p>
                        <p>Since they require an initial deposit before you can unlock them,  they’re not free. But, there are still <strong>some advantages</strong> to that type of offer:</p>
                        <p>✔️ You can get a bigger number of free spins (for example, 200 vs 30) </p>
                        <p>✔️ Some casinos will let you choose the game you use your free spins on </p>
                        <p>✔️ The wagering requirements vary, but they can be very decent</p>
                        <p>What are the downsides?</p>
                        <p>❌ Game restrictions might still apply, you don’t get to pick out of the casinos entire offer. </p>
                        <p>❌ You have to deposit, so there’s some risk involved. </p>
                        <p>❌ There are caps on your earnings </p>
                        <p>❌ The wagering requirements might ask you to play through the bonus plus deposit a number of times.</p>
                        <p>Still, these free spins can be a good way to get some free spins at a great casino with a fair bonus.</p>
                        <div className="h3">Regular or Seasonal Free Spins</div>
                        <p>Most Bitcoin casinos that do reward their players with a welcome bonus – and even some who don’t, like <a className="text-blue-700" href="/stake-bitcoin-casino-review/">Stake casino</a> – offer other types of promotions to regular players on a regular basis. </p>
                        <p>While these offers aren’t limited to free spins, they are certainly one of the most common type of rewards players can get. </p>
                        <p>You can unlock them in several ways, including:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm"><li>With a qualifying deposit</li><li>When winning a competition, like a leaderboard challenge</li><li>As a <em>free bonus </em>given at the casino’s discretion</li><li>As an incentive to try out certain games</li><li>While wagering on specific games</li></ul>
                        <p>When it comes to terms and conditions, these offers are <strong>generally more flexible than welcome bonuses</strong>, although not always. Our advice? Make sure you read the terms and conditions before taking part in any promotion.</p>
                        <div className="h3">VIP Free Spins</div>
                        <p>The best deals you can get at Bitcoin casinos, including the most generous Bitcoin casino free spins, are generally given out as VIP rewards or as part of loyalty clubs.</p>
                        <p>All casinos work a bit differently here. Some are very secretive about their VIP tiers, which means you won’t know much about it until you are actually invited to join. Others have clearly defined reward systems that give you free spins <strong>when you level up</strong> by playing at the casino.</p>
                        <p>In any case, VIP free spins tend to have the lowest wagering requirements and the highest value. It’s also not unusual for you to receive free spins that are catered to you, on games that you actually care about!</p>
                        <div className="h3">Free Money Rounds</div>
                        <p>While they’re not usually categorized alongside other free spin bonuses, <strong>demonstration game rounds</strong> (playable with virtual funds and, sometimes, worthless in-house tokens) <strong>are technically the same thing</strong>: game rounds that you can play for free at Bitcoin casinos.</p>
                        <p>The main difference is that you <strong>cannot win real funds</strong>. For that reason, they’re suitable only for those that don’t want to gamble with real money but still enjoy the thrill or, more likely, if you’re just testing the casino or a new game.</p>
                        <p>In any case, they’re always welcome, even if just for a bit of casual fun!</p>

                        <div className="h2">How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Free Spins</div>
                        <p>If you’ve read this far, you already understand there are many types of free spin deals at Bitcoin casinos, and not all give you the same value. </p>
                        <p>For that reason, it’s important to keep a few things in mind if you want to get the most out of your Bitcoin casino free spins:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list"><li><strong>Free Spin Value</strong><br />Most casino games are made to cater to a wide variety of players, and <a className="text-blue-700" href="/best-bitcoin-wallet-for-online-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wallets</a>. You can get pretty granular with your spending habits when you’re gambling your own money. Free spins on the other hand? They’re as much as the casino gives you. <br />Often, providers will tell you the <em>number </em>of free spins but hide their actual value deep in the <em>Terms &amp; Conditions</em>. But, if you want to truly compare and pick out the best offer, look for high-value spins, not just a high number.</li><li><strong>Eligible Games</strong><br />We’ve mentioned before that some Bitcoin free spin offers are stricter than others, with some being exclusively for one game, and others allowing you to pick between multiple games.<br />Much to our dismay, you don’t often find free spins on provably fair slots, especially those developed by the casinos themselves. There is one notable exception, however: <a className="text-blue-700" href="/bgaming-bitcoin-casinos/">BGaming slots</a>. Keep an eye out for their special offers which give you even more bang for your buck!</li><li><strong>Wagering Requirements</strong><br />By now you should know that the “freer” the free spins, the higher the wagering requirements. <br />Deals like FortuneJack’s 50 wager-free and no deposit free spins are extremely hard to find, and even harder to beat, but even those come with other terms and conditions!</li><li><strong>Caps on Winnings</strong><br />Casinos are businesses – they don’t want to give out money for free. When you play and win with a no-deposit free spin, they get no profit. This is why a lot of gambling sites will cap your winnings when it comes to free spins.<br />Not all free spin offers limit how much Bitcoin you can win, though. As a rule of thumb, if the wagering requirements are minimal, there will probably be a limit. <br />It’s important that you’re aware of these caps so you’re not disappointed. After all, there’s nothing worse than thinking you’ve won big… Only to realize you can get a fraction of your prize! Cancel the champagne? Nope, just read the fine print first.</li></ol>
                        <div className="h2">Final Thoughts</div>
                        <p>Free spins allow you to enjoy casino games for free and still win prizes. But, they all come with a catch – you can’t withdraw the money until you complete the wagering requirements. </p>
                        <p>When comparing Bitcoin free spins, this number can help you evaluate if the offer is worth it. For instance, if you have to play through x50 of your winnings, your actual profit is very low. And, don’t forget to consider other factors like caps on winnings, bet value, and the overall casino quality. </p>
                        <p><strong>Ultimately, Bitcoin casino free spins help you explore new gambling sites </strong>and find exciting experiences to add to your routine. Don’t look at them as a way to make crazy money. Instead, use them to get a taste for casinos and pick out your favorite one. </p>
                        <p>If you’re wondering which provider to choose, check out our top picks: BC.Game for their wager-free and deposit-free spins, and True Flip for their low-wager, no deposit welcome bonus. </p>

In fact, free spins are one of the most common offers at Bitcoin casinos like BitStarz or <a className="text-blue-700" href="/go/true-flip/">True Flip</a>. Do note that you may not be playing with Bitcoin, however, since it's not unusual for free spins to be paid out in fiat even if your account is in BTC or other coins.</div>

                                    It depends. For the most part, no. Most free spin offers require an initial deposit. While some free spin offers are, indeed, on the house, they tend to have strict terms and conditions that make them less appealing. However, they're a good way to test new games without having to invest your own money. In that sense, free spin offers are, indeed, free, since you're not using real money (even if you have to make a deposit to unlock them).
