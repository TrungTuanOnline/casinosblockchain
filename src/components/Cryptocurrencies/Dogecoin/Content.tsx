                        <p>There are a few things you should always consider when looking for a new Dogecoin gambling website:</p>

                            <li>Is it safe?</li>

                            <li>Are there any interesting promotions, including a good welcome bonus?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>With Dogecoin, however, we’ve looked at another factor. We call it <strong>the fun factor</strong>. After all, Dogecoin doesn’t take itself seriously, so neither should your choice of website.</p>

                        <img src={BcGame} className="w-full h-auto" alt="bc-game" />
                        <p className="mt-4">Innovative and DOGE-friendly,<strong> </strong>BC.Game ranks first in our selection. Standout features include: </p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm">
                            <li><strong>Low house edge</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>20 BC.Game originals</strong>, all provably fair</li>
                            <li><strong>100+ live tables</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Fully DOGE-compatible </strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Social casino </strong>with rewards for participating in the community</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mt-8">The only downside? BC.Game <strong>doesn’t offer a welcome bonus. Instead, you get free spins</strong> for a chance to win up to 1 BTC – far more than a regular deposit bonus, but there are no guarantees you’ll win . </p>
                        <p>Still, even with the bonus hitch, BC.Game remains our favorite DOGE casino: </p>
                        <p>? <strong>Dogecoin Compatibility: 5/5 </strong></p>
                        <p>BC.Game offers a wide range of games + unique social perks and it’s all available to Dogecoin players.  </p>

                            <li><strong>Robust sportsbook </strong>with all your favorite tournaments</li>

                        <p>Just like BC.Game, Stake doesn’t have a traditional welcome bonus. Instead, they have reward programs and a weekly giveaway for $5000. That, along with the sleek look and low house edge games more than make up for the lack.</p>
                        <p><strong>?</strong> <strong>Dogecoin Compatibility: 4.5/5 </strong> </p>
                        <p>Stake is fully DOGE-compatible. Both the casino product and sportsbook accept the altcoin along with other cryptos.</p>

                        <p>Last on the top three list, mBit stands out with a <strong>huge welcome bonus </strong>of 110% and a range of fun games. Its main advantages include: </p>
                        <ul className="is-style-checked-list_sm">
                            <li><strong>Fully DOGE-compatible </strong></li>

Cult classics are missing from mBit’s portfolio and so are provably fair games. Though the casino is licensed and trustworthy, we always recommend provably fair gambling if available. </p>
                        <p>? <strong>Dogecoin Compatibility: 4.5/5</strong></p>
                        <p>mBit offers plenty of DOGE-friendly fun and a generous bonus. We wish they had provably fair games, though. </p>

                            Dogecoin Bonuses
                        </div>
                        <p>Dogecoin casino bonuses work <strong>like any other cryptocurrency</strong>. Usually, these are welcome promos (though there are some no deposit ones) for getting started in the casino. And we have to give it to DOGE casino bonuses – the large numbers look extremely enticing!</p>
                        <p>But don’t get too excited: because of the currency’s own low value, <strong>Dogecoin bonuses often give you less value for money </strong>than Bitcoin or Ethereum bonuses.</p>
                        <p>For instance, BitStarz’s fantastic <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/go/bitstarz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100% up to 1,000,000 DOGE</a> first deposit bonus is a thing of beauty. However, its counterpart of up to 1 Bitcoin is worth considerably more.</p>
                        <p>You can also get free spin offers at Dogecoin casinos, some of which <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/bitcoin-no-deposit-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without even making your first deposit</a>! </p>
                        <p>We selected the following three as the very best <strong>Dogecoin gambling bonuses</strong>:</p>

                            mBit gives you a 110% bonus on your initial deposit. Up to the equivalent of 5 BTC, too!
                        </p>
                        <p>At <strong>mBit Casino </strong>you get a <strong>110% gift </strong>on your original deposit. Many online casinos will match your first deposit – but mBit goes above and beyond. </p>
                        <p>The best part? </p>
                        <p>You’re not getting short-changed for using DOGE. The maximum bonus is the <strong>equivalent of 5 BTC</strong>, no matter the currency. At the time of writing, this means you can get almost $40,000 worth of Dogecoin – and this will likely go up. </p>

                            Pros and Cons of Dogecoin Casinos
                        </div>
                        <p>Sure, Dogecoin might have <em>some </em>merit to it, plus Elon Musk’s blessing. But it’s still a meme coin.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Why would you use DOGE to gamble?</strong> Let’s look at the pros and cons of Dogecoin casinos.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Some of the <strong>main perks</strong> of playing with DOGE include:&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>Low cost </strong>– Dogecoin has grown in the past few years, but it still stays under $1. This means you can play with smaller amounts – and use this to control your losses.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>Small deposits are possible </strong>– Every casino has a minimum deposit. The catch? They vary across cryptos. So, while you can’t deposit $10 worth of Bitcoin (it’s under the minimum for most casinos), you can do it with DOGE.</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>Popularity </strong>– Dogecoin is one of the top cryptos in the world. You can buy it at virtually every exchange and play with it in many online casinos.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>Volatility </strong>– DOGE’s price takes dramatic swings up and down. When you’re gambling with DOGE, in a way, you’re also betting on the price movements. If the coin suddenly starts trading up, your earnings automatically grow, too.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>Privacy </strong>– This is an inherent perk of many cryptocurrencies. With DOGE, you can <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/anonymous-bitcoin-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play anonymously</a>, keeping prying eyes away from your gambling.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>But, the cute ol’ puppy isn’t without <strong>downsides</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>❌ <strong>Volatility </strong>– That’s right, volatility can come back to haunt you. Major price movements can eat up your profits, so keep an eye on the markets.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>❌ <strong>Volatility </strong>– That’s right, volatility can come back to haunt you. Major price movements can eat up your profits, so keep an eye on the markets.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>❌ <strong>Easy to lose track </strong>– DOGE numbers are high, often in the millions. That’s why gambling with Dogecoin can feel like using play money. When a single DOGE is worth pennies, it’s easy to lose track and gamble much more than you originally intended?&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>❌ <strong>Not all casinos </strong>– While major crypto casinos accept Dogecoin, it’s still not as mainstream as BTC. Your preferred game hub might simply not offer the coin.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, despite the cons, we think DOGE is a worthy coin to gamble with. But, if you’re looking for more stability, why not try a stablecoin like <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/tether-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether </a>instead?</p>

                        <p>The good news? Whether you’re a Craps enthusiast or a dice slots aficionado, most DOGE casinos have your preferred dice games. </p>
                        <p>BC.Game, for example, has <strong>dice originals </strong>along with third-party provider favorites. Their DOGE dice offer includes three <strong>provably fair dice games </strong>from their own developpers: </p>

                        <p>Then, they also have DOGE-friendly <strong>dice games from other</strong> providers – Scratch Dice, Ancient Troy Dice, Lightning Dice and so much more. </p>
                        <p>The best part? All of the provably fair games and many of the others have <strong>99% RTP </strong>and minimal house edge!</p>

                        <ul className="is-style-dotted-list">
                            <li><strong>Bankroll management is key</strong> – only bet what you can afford to lose.</li>
                            <li>It’s also a good idea to <strong>choose casinos with a low house edge</strong>. Games like blackjack and baccarat have relatively low house edges, while games like slots tend to be riskier.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don’t forget about bonuses and promotions</strong>. Many casinos offer sign-up bonuses or reload bonuses, which can give you extra money to play with. Taking advantage of these offers can help you build up your bankroll and improve your chances of winning big at the casino.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some of the Dogecoin casinos where you get the most value for your money include Stake and BC.Game – both of them have games with a house edge as low as 1%!</p>

                            <li>Processing times are fast and often cost-free.</li>

                            Dogecoin Vs Bitcoin
                        </div>
                        <p>Now that we covered DOGE transactions, let’s talk about how they’re different (and maybe even better) than Bitcoin:</p>
                        <p>To understand the differences (and similarities) between Bitcoin and DOGE, we must go back to <strong>Dogecoin’s origins</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The meme coin started as a fork of Lucky Coin, which itself is a <strong>fork of Bitcoin</strong>. Cryptocurrency forks are changes to the underlying blockchain protocol. This means that DOGE uses <strong>some core Bitcoin features</strong> – but changes others. For example, both Dogecoin and Bitcoin use proof-of-work consensus where miners solve complicated math problems (do work) to validate new blocks.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Dogecoin also uses chunks of <strong>code from</strong> <strong>Litecoin</strong>, which is where it gets the scrypt encryption.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>All that said, DOGE is still its own cryptocurrency with unique characteristics. </p>
                        <p>Here’s <strong>how it stacks up to Bitcoin</strong>:</p>

                        <p className="mt-2">* Although DOGE uses Proof-of-Work right now, they’re <strong>moving to Proof-of-Stake</strong> as an eco-friendly alternative. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://www.binance.com/en/news/top/6657179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently joined</a> the process, so look out for the update soon. </p>
                        <p>** Bitcoin’s block reward <strong>halves every 210,000 blocks </strong>or approximately every four years.</p>
                        <div className="h4">Could Dogecoin Be Better Than Bitcoin?</div>
                        <p><strong>Wondering about the encryption? This is actually one place where DOGE is better than BTC (yes, really.)</strong></p>
                        <p>Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hash standard for its Proof-of-Work consensus. In PoW, miners race to find a block hash by solving a complex math problem. The more powerful your device is, the more likely it is you’ll win the reward. BTC miners use specific graphics cards called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)<strong> </strong>to improve their chances of finding the block hash first. </p>
                        <p>The problem? <strong>ASICs are <em>very </em>pricey</strong>. New miners stand a very slim chance of getting any BTC for their efforts, while the big fish scoop up the profits. </p>
                        <p>DOGE’s Scrypt encryption<strong> </strong>solves this by banishing ASICs altogether. </p>
                        <p><strong>Since Scrypt doesn’t support ASICs, traditional mining hardware works better – and even newbies can get a share of the DOGE pie! </strong></p>
                        <p>But, don’t get us wrong: </p>

                        <p>Like any other online casino out there, Dogecoin casinos are safe <strong>if they hold a trusted gambling license</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Often, cryptocurrency casinos can legally operate without one since payments might not be considered monetary transactions – a legislation loophole.</p>
                        <p>This means that you can choose to play at an unlicensed casino when using Dogecoin, but we really don’t recommend it. </p>
                        <p>If you insist, <strong>stick to provably fair casinos</strong> where you can verify the outcome of every game round. Otherwise, you don’t have anything to fall back on.</p>
                        <p>We also suggest that you play at a <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/languages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casino that speaks your native language</a>. This way, you won’t get duped by intricate terms and conditions that you can’t understand. You’d also get better customer support by agents who speak your language. </p>

                        <p className="mt-10">Since online gambling is banned in certain countries, some players might be tempted to use a VPN to circumvent geo-restrictions. However, most DOGE casinos don’t allow you to use a VPN for this purpose. If they detect that you’re using a VPN to hide your location, they could suspend your account.</p>
                        <p><strong>That being said, you can still use a VPN to protect your privacy.</strong> Just make sure that you’re not using it to try and trick the casino.</p>
