                        <p>It’s no surprise, then, that Ethereum casinos are a dime a dozen. But which one is the best?</p>
                        <p>That’s what we’re here for.&nbsp;We regularly review and rate Ethereum casinos, so you don’t have to! </p>
                        <p>We playtest and write reviews for each of the brands featured on this page. In this article, we will share all the info we have collected throughout our testing. We will also give you an Ethereum casino tutorial to help you get started – yes, even if you don’t know a thing about ETH gambling. </p>

                        <div className="h3">How We Write Our Ethereum Casino Reviews</div>
                        <p>Our Ethereum casino reviews are based on <em>first-hand </em>experience while playtesting each website. We don’t get paid to review casinos. However, if you click one of our links, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This allows us to keep the site going and provide you with better, more comprehensive information. </p>
                        <p>Learn more about our reviewing method below.</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list">
                            <li><strong>We sign up at each website anonymously.</strong><br />As reviewers, we understand that we can only have a <em>real</em> player experience if we don’t identify ourselves as members of CasinosBlockchain.
                                <p>For that reason, we never tell brands that we are going to review them. Instead, we create accounts using our personal information, which we keep anonymous on this website.</p></li>
                            <li><strong>We deposit using our own money.</strong><br />When creating an account, the first thing we test is how fast the Ethereum payments are processed.
                                <p>We also redeem any ETH bonuses available to understand if the terms and conditions are fair and how they compare to other Ethereum casino offers.</p></li>
                            <li><strong>We play and (hopefully) win.</strong><br />Before we can recommend a casino, we want to get a good feel for their game offering. Are there enough games? Are they actually fun? This is our favorite part of the test – we get to enjoy the casino experience as a user would. </li>
                            <li><strong>We withdraw.</strong><br />As seasoned players, we know that negative casino experiences often come when it’s time to withdraw your winnings. Is withdrawing quick and easy or a painful process? There’s no way to know unless we try.</li>
                            <li><strong>We talk to customer support.</strong><br />If there was only one tip we could give you before you sign up at an Ethereum casino, is this one: always test the customer support first.
                                <p>A professional, polite, and helpful customer support team doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll have a great experience there. But if they’re immediately rude or dismissive, then you know this is not the place for your Ether.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And there you have it – this is how we select the best Ethereum casinos for you. </p>
                        <p>By doing an anonymous playtest and then analyzing the results, we can be sure that you’re getting the best possible experience. So why not try out one of the casinos on this list and see for yourself if they’re right for you?</p>

                        <p>When preparing our Ethereum casino reviews, there are three things we always take into consideration:</p>
                        <ol className="is-style-dotted-list">
                            <li>Is the casino safe?</li>
                            <li>What games does it offer?</li>
                            <li>Does it have any enticing bonuses?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Although the complete list of Ethereum casinos (as you can see above) that we have reviewed is much more extensive, in the end, four brands stood out from the rest. Let’s find out why!</p>

                        <p>Although this transparency is appreciated, the fact is that all payments are as fast as it gets, especially when using Ethereum. </p>

                        <p>The downside? Some players report withdrawal issues with BitStarz.</p>
                        <p>⚠️ <strong>Since BitStarz is restricted in some countries</strong>, you’re expected to check if it’s available in your country before signing up. The caveat is the casino itself doesn’t do a Know-Your-Consumer (KYC) check, so you’ll be asked to provide identification documents only after you try to cash out.</p>
                        <p><strong>Withdrawal issues happen with players who didn’t prove they’re in an allowed country</strong>, so it’s important to follow the casino’s instructions to avoid this.<br />Overall, BitStarz is still one of the most reputable Ethereum casinos today, which is why we included it in our top selection.</p>

You can use the Ethereum network to send money, as well as build applications. There are over 3000 Dapps on the Ethereum network – and the number is growing every day.</p>
                        <p>Because Ethereum Dapps are spread out over the entire network, they come with a range of unique perks:</p>

                            <li><strong>Safer data </strong>– the information on Dapps is stored on the blockchain; it can’t be modified or lost without messing up the ledger – essentially, it’s a shared database. This keeps your information much more secure. </li>
                            <li><strong>Open source and transparent </strong>– the Ethereum blockchain is public, so ETH Dapps can’t hide information from you. In gambling this means provable fairness – the games are fair by design and you can verify that at any time.  </li>
                            <li><strong>Less downtime </strong>– Dapps don’t use a single server, they exist on the blockchain; they’re less likely to go offline or suffer long downtimes.</li>

                        <div className="h2">Ethereum Casino Tutorial: How to Get Started</div>
                        <p>Now that we covered the top Ethereum casinos out there, here’s how to get started with the altcoin. Here’s your mini tutorial to ETH casinos:</p>
                        <ul className="is-style-dotted-list">
                            <li><strong>Set up your wallet.</strong><br />Just like regular money, your crypto goes into a wallet. There is a wide range of options that support Ethereum. <br />Our favorite? MetaMask. <br />MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app you can download for free. It’s incredibly user-friendly and holds Ethereum, as well as a range of other tokens. <br />Learn more about <a className="text-blue-700" href="/metamask-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaMask casinos</a> in our dedicated article. </li>
                            <li><strong><strong>Buy Ethereum</strong></strong>.<br />Once you have your MetaMask wallet set up, you will need to purchase some Ethereum. You can do this on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. <br />Crypto exchanges are just like regular exchanges (for fiat), but they allow you to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies. Since Ethereum is one of the most popular altcoins (it is THE altcoin), it’s available on most exchanges.<br />So how do you choose an exchange? <br />We recommend starting with Coinbase, as it is one of the most user-friendly exchanges and is available in most countries. Binance is also a great option, as it has a wide range of coins available for purchase. It has lower fees than Coinbase, but beginners might find it more difficult to work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transfer to your wallet.</strong><br />Once you have your Ethereum on an exchange, you will need to transfer it to your MetaMask wallet. This is a simple process and just requires you to copy the address of your MetaMask wallet and paste it into the “send” field on the exchange.<br />Never keep money on the exchange for longer than necessary. Exchanges are vulnerable to hacks, and you don’t want to lose your hard-earned Ethereum!</li>
                            <li><strong>Sign up for an ETH-friendly casino</strong>.<br />Now that you have your Ethereum, it’s time to have some fun! <br />Sign up for an ETH-friendly casino like BC.Game. <br />BC.Game offers a range of games, including blackjack, roulette, and slots. Many of their games are provably fair, meaning you can check the legitimacy of each outcome. We already covered our top picks for Ethereum casinos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deposit your Ethereum.</strong><br />Once you’ve registered for an account, you can make your first deposit and start playing for real. Most casinos also allow you to play for free to test the games out, so you can practice before risking any real money. <br />BC.Game also offers a free daily wheel spin for a chance to win exciting rewards.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There you have it – it really is as easy as 1-2-3! Now you can start enjoying all the benefits of Ethereum gaming.</p>

                        <p>For the most part, Ethereum bonuses are just like any other casino bonus, with one big difference: their value can fluctuate.</p>
                        <p>Like any other&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" target="_blank" href="/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a>, Ether is volatile, both good and bad for you. For example, you might have signed up for a 15 ETH bonus that suddenly becomes 50% more valuable… or 50% less.</p>
                        <p><strong>It’s like you’re betting on your bonus as well as on the games</strong>, which can be as thrilling as it is terrifying.</p>

                        <p>✔️ <strong>Fast transactions </strong></p>
                        <p>The Ethereum network can handle between <strong>15 and 45 transactions per second. </strong>Compare that to Bitcoin, which only processes seven (and guarantees four.)</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>No reversals </strong></p>
                        <p>Once you send an ETH transaction, it’s final.&nbsp;Since Ethereum transfers can’t be reversed, there’s no way for the casinos to take back your money.</p>
                        <p>✔️ <strong>Provable fairness</strong></p>

Crypto casinos are increasingly implementing provable fairness and ETH allows them to do it. Blockchain casinos are governed by overseeable code, they’re provably fair by design. Non-blockchain casinos can also provide provable fairness and ways to verify it. </p>

                        <p>If you play in a typical casino using Ethereum, then the process is quite similar to when you pay with other cryptocurrencies, with a few notable advantages:</p>

                            <li>Processing times are often quicker.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>With casino Dapps, this is quite a different story. </p>
                        <p>Since the games are provably fair, often the casino doesn’t have a license, which means you can <strong>skip the KYC obligations and get your wins straight to your Ethereum wallet</strong>.&nbsp;However, we never recommend that you play at unlicensed casinos or Dapps.</p>

                        <p>You should bear in mind when playing in a casino using Ethereum that&nbsp;<strong>you are responsible for keeping track of the value fluctuation of the cryptocurrency</strong>.</p>
                        <p>As we mentioned before, cryptocurrencies such as ETH can be pretty volatile, which means that a 1ETH deposit yielding twice that in winnings can suddenly see its value reduced or increased.</p>
                        <p>This extra uncertainty is very appealing for some players, who enjoy the extra edge brought to their games. However, others prefer a more stable playing field.</p>

                            <li>To allow for that,&nbsp;<strong>some casinos offer currency conversions</strong>, letting you deposit and withdraw in ETH but play in a fiat currency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For the most part, if you play with Ether, you’ll be paid out in Ether.</p>

                            Are Ethereum Casinos Safe?
                        </div>
                        <p>The short answer to this question is: ‘Yes, as long as you play at a licensed casino.’</p>
                        <p>Playing at unlicensed casinos is always a risk, no matter what currency or technology you use, since it’s much easier for them to disappear with your money without a regulator to look over their shoulder.</p>
                        <p>Provably fair casinos and casinos with fully disclosed smart contracts can counter this risk, however, since your gameplay will be fully verifiable.</p>
                        <p>It might also be a good idea to play at a&nbsp;<a className="text-blue-700" href="/languages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casino available in your language</a>, making sure that you understand all terms and conditions.</p>
                        <div className="h2">Final Thoughts</div>
                        <p>Ethereum casinos are a fun and exciting way to gamble online. The ETH network is also growing in importance when it comes to <a className="text-blue-700" href="https://casinosblockchain.io/metaverse-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaverse casinos</a>. </p>
                        <p>They allow you to use Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, to place bets and play games. ETH comes with plenty of perks for gamblers:</p>
                        <p>Ethereum <strong>transactions are faster</strong> than other cryptos (like Bitcoin), meaning you can deposit and withdraw almost instantly. Additionally, Ethereum-based casinos are <strong>often provably fair</strong>, meaning that you can verify that the games you are playing are fair and not rigged. This builds trust between the casino and the player. Finally, because Ethereum is a blockchain-based technology, it is <strong>secure and transparent</strong>. This means that you can be sure that your funds are safe and that the casino is not cheating.</p>
                        <p>If you are looking for a new way to gamble online, then Ethereum casinos are a great option for you. We hope our mini Ethereum casino tutorial helped out.</p>
                        <p>We recommend <strong>starting out with BC.Game</strong>. They offer a <strong>huge portfolio of games</strong>, including slots, roulette, blackjack, and more. There is also a selection of <strong>provably fair games available</strong>, so you can be sure that the outcomes fair and random.</p>
